# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

      Software Engineer with nearly 3 years of experience building production Rails applications at scale. Specialized in fullstack end-to-end development, from backend architecture and API design to responsive interface implementation.

      I'm passionate about solving complex problems with clean and scalable code, with strong focus on developer experience, testing, and quality. Creator of command_deck, an open source Rails engine that improves developer experience through a quick actions panel for devs.

      I value teams that move fast without sacrificing quality, make decisions based on first principles, and build products with real impact.
